Usermod to use ERCF on a Creality printer, running KLIPPER and Bondtech DDX V3 extruder 

Its not possible to mount a Sensor between the extruder gears and the hotend. This mod uses a micro switch to detect the movement of
the extruder latch. Normaly the filament is feed to the hotend without problems after entering the extruder gears.

Mod was designed to be used on the Ender 6, but should work on any Creality printer, compatible with the DDX V3
This mod is designed to work with the stock cable hose and uses the Z-Endstop (not needed anymore with blTouch). 



Step file included, if you want to modify it for your needs. (maybe a little bit chaotic)

Material needed:

- 1x Ruthex M4S
- 1x Microswitch e.g. SS-5GL
- 2x cable ties (thickness ~1,5mm, width max. 5mm)  

Printed in PLA, ABS not tested. Tollerances are tight, so printer schould be well callibrated.
